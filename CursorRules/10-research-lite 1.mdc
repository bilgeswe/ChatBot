  </when_to_trigger>

  - Keep prompts precise; avoid conflicting asks; stay within the **tool_budget** from core rules.
  - Capture: title, link, **access date**, version/deprecation notes. Note disagreements and propose a conservative path.
  </how_to_research>

  <outputs>
  - Update the PLAN with a **concise** findings block and decision rationale.
